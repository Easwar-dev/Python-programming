# Division is decimal by default
print(5 / 2)

# Double slash rounds down
print(5 // 2)

# CAREFUL: most languages round towards 0 by default
# So negative numbers will round down
print(-3 // 2)

# A workaround for rounding towards zero
# is to use decimal division and then convert to int.
print(int(-3 / 2))

# Modding is similar to most languages
print(10 % 3)

# Except for negative values
print(-10 % 3)
